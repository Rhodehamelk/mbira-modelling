## unpredictable behaviour
The two frequencies that result from two lengths that are close to each other (e.g. 128, 132) are not close to each other. This behaviour is unpredictable.

There is no obvious discrepency in the values of the frequencies that correspond to the lengths. Perhaps the issue relates to the PyAudio write streams.
