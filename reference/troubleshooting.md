## unpredictable behaviour
The two frequencies that result from two lengths that are close to each other (e.g. 128, 132) are not close to each other. This behaviour is unpredictable. Does it result from a software bug? Perhaps to plot a graph of length vs frequency will shed some insight on the issue.
