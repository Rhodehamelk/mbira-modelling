Karigamombe is a traditional mbira tune that is typically the first tune a player will learn. It is not very complex, as it's primordial form does not include any of the tines played by the right index finger. It is also played by the thumbs together, so it will make for an easy piece to let this model play. A simple notation based on the indexing found in [reference.md](reference.md) follows:

| Phrase 1 | Phrase 2 | Phrase 3 | Phrase 4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| L1, R2   | L1, R2   | L1, R2   | B7, R3   |
| L2, R2   | L2, R2   | L2, R2   | L4, R3   |
| L5, R1   | L5, R1   | L3, R2   | L3, R2   |
| L5, R1   | L5, R1   | L3, R2   | L3, R2   |
| L2, R3   | L4, R1   | L4, R1   | L4, R1   |
| L2, R3   | L4, R1   | L4, R1   | L4, R1   |

This four phrase structure is typical of mbira music and characterizes every example of the music.

As an array of consecutive note pairs, the tune is as follows:

```
[(L1, R2), (L2, R2), (L5, R1), (L5, R1), (L2, R3), (L2, R3),
 (L1, R2), (L2, R2), (L5, R1), (L5, R1), (L4, R1), (L4, R1),
 (L1, R2), (L2, R2), (L3, R2), (L3, R2), (L4, R1), (L4, R1),
 (B7, R3), (L4, R3), (L3, R2), (L3, R2), (L4, R1), (L4, R1)]
