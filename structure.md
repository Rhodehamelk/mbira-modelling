# structure

The tines of an mbira dzavadzimu are laid out accordingly:

Hence it makes sense to structure the digital approximation of an mbira in the same way.

Let $B$ be the set of tines in the lower left register, $L$ be the set of tines in the middle left register, and $R$ be the set of tines in the right register. Then tines are numbered in increasing order from the lowest pitch, such that upper right tine (in red) is R9 and the upper left tine (also in red) is L6.

Paul Berliner's "The Soul of Mbira" (1978) compares the tunings of five different instruments observed in Zimbabwe. One such tuning, that of a certain John Gondo's mbira, will be used here to help build the model of a whole mbira.

$B = \set{122, 147, 161, 177, 197, 215, 263} \land L = \set{241, 363, 325, 393, 432, 480} \land R = \set{293, 485, 538, 616, 660, 733, 800, 878, 981}$

Where the values are given in Hertz.
