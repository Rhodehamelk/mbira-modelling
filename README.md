# mbira-modelling
Mbira is a family of instruments that originated in Zimbabwe over 500 years ago.
The music is characterized by melodic and complex rhythmic variations on a theme, akin to European classical music.
Don't expect familiarity, though. This is music of a language group much older than that which English is from.

## About the project
I am motivated to explore physical modelling techniques on a variety of levels:

- Basic: generate tones with a differential equation that describes the motion of a tine of a certain dimension, struck with a specific velocity.

- Intermediate: synthesize a differential equation that decribes the resonance of the wooden soundboard, and combine.

- Advanced: consider FM synthesis techniques to add noise and buzzing to generated tones.

## Technical Details
It would not be difficult to write score files and MIDI capabilities with a functional basic implementation.
At that point, we would determine the applicability of real-time wave calculation versus a wavetable stored in memory.

My current thoughts are that, due to the small count of tines (n < 30), the wavetable approach makes more sense.
However, that may not afford variable velocity â€” in which case, I think real-time tone generation makes more sense.

I am not attached to using Rust as the language of choice, but it is what I have considered so far.
