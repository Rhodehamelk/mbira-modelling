# mbira-modelling
Mbira is a family of instruments that originated in Zimbabwe over 500 years ago.
The music is characterized by melodic and complex rhythmic variations on a theme, akin to European classical music (but with a greater historical emphasis on night-long, trance-induced spirit medium possession).

## About the project
The first objective is to describe a set of pitches of accurate tone and timbre by means of a mathematical model of an abstract mbira tine.

- Objective 1 is to define a differential equation that describes the dampened sinusoidal motion of a struck mbira tine. (see: mathematics.md)

- Objective 2 is to synthesize one tone, then two tones played separately, then two tones played together.

- Objective 3 is to create a digital structure that replicates the complex layout of tines on an mbira.

- Objective 4 is to write a program that will play an input score.

- Objective 5, if time affords it, will be to implement a FFT to deconstruct a recorded mbira performance into a score.


## Technical Details
The language of choice for this project is Python.
